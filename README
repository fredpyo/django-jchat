Notes on how to deploy this demo
================================
Hi, you are about to test this demo project for the django-jchat application I developed for the
django web framework (www.djangoproject.com). This is merely an example project made for you to
see the app in action and see some of the possibilities it provides.

Installing
==========
Just unpack this somewhere, run the "manage.py syncdb" command (you'll need to add a super user
when prompted, for you will be logged in with that user when testing the app automatically).
Then run the "manage.py runserver" command and point your browser to the app, and test away!
By the way: the project uses fixtures to load initial data for the demos.
